# TEA_Implementation_cpp

This project was made for educational purposes but can serve practical ones too. 
You can use the algorithm to encrypt and decrypt (important) text.
 
## What is TEA (Tiny Encryption Algorithm)

In cryptography, the Tiny Encryption Algorithm (TEA) is a block cipher notable for its simplicity of description and implementation, 
designed by David Wheeler and Roger Needham of the Cambridge Computer Laboratory.

## How to use

- teaEncode.cpp is used to encrypt a file and teaDecode.cpp is used to decrypt it. You can of course see the implementation and change it as you see fit.
- 2 executable windows files with the same name are provided if you want to use TEA without compilation. By default in plaintext.txt there is the initial
plaintext. In encrypted.txt, the text after the encryption is generated and in decrypted.txt the text after decryption is generated, but you can use another filenames.
It is asked while you run the executables.
